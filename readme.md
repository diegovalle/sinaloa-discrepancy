Reconciling homicide counts in Sinaloa
--------------------------------------

This program analyzes the discrepancy in the homicide
data for the state of Sinaloa. In 2007 and 2008 there
were more drug-war related murders than total murders
which, of course, should be impossible. This program shows
the discrepancy was due to an excess of deaths registered
as accidents whose cause of injury was a firearm.
