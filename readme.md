Reconciling homicide counts in Sinaloa
======================================

This program analyzes the discrepancy in the homicide
data for the state of Sinaloa. 


In 2007 and 2008 there
were more drug-war related murders than total murders
which, of course, should be impossible. This program shows
the discrepancy was due to an excess of deaths registered
as accidents whose cause of injury was a firearm. I tried to classify the individual deaths into accidents and homicides, but the characteristics of accidents by firearm and homicides by firearm are too close to produce reliable results.


Data
----

In the data directory you'll find the following files:

*drug-homicides.csv.bz2*: All drug war related homicides (also called organize crime related or due to delinquent rivalry) from Dec 2006 to Dec 2010 in all of Mexico

*municipality-heads.csv.bz2*: A list of the names of each municipality in 2007

*sinaloa-deaths.csv.bz2*: All injury intent deaths (accidents, suicides, homicides, unspecified, and legal operations) registered in the state of Sinaloa by the Mexican vital statistic system from 2004 to 2009

The file _DE-SSA08.doc_ contains a description of the variables in sinaloa-deaths.csv.bz2 (Spanish)
